# Parkinson's Disease Prediction using CatBoost, Optuna, and SMOTE

This project detects Parkinson's Disease using voice-based biomarkers analyzed with a CatBoost model optimized by Optuna and balanced with SMOTE.  
A Flask-based web app provides real-time, non-invasive PD prediction.

## 🚀 Features
- Voice feature-based PD classification
- CatBoost + Optuna hyperparameter tuning
- SMOTE for class balancing
- Flask web interface for real-time prediction

## 🧠 Model Accuracy
- Precision: 0.967
- Recall: 1.000
- F1-Score: 0.983
- Overall Accuracy: 98.31%

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Flask
- CatBoost, Optuna, SMOTE
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- HTML, CSS
